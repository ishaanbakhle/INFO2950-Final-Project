Data sources that I am considering: 
- Number of tweets mentioning healthcare over the past few months to assess how the spread of the coronavirus
impacts popular concern regarding global healthcare systems.  I would aggregate this dataset using the 
Twitter API, which I have made a request for.
- The IMF's consumer price index dataset in order to see how recent commercial and international relations
developments have impacted trade.  The dataset can be found at http://data.imf.org/?sk=4FFB52B2-3653-409A-B471-D47B46D904B5.
- NYC taxi trip data to assess how recent state and federal travel and commuting advisory affects taxi use.
The data can be found at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.
